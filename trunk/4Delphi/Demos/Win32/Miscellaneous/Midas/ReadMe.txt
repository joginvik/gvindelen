Demonstrates using the MIDAS technology with IBDAC. This project consists of
two parts:
	1) a MIDAS server, that processes requests to the database
	2) a thin MIDAS client that displays an interactive grid.
This demo shows how to build thin clients that display interactive components and delegate
all database interaction to a server application for processing.
