Demonstrates creating and loading DLLs for IBDAC-based projects. This demo
project consists of two parts - an IBCDll project that creates a DLL of a
form that sends a query to the server and displays its results, and an
IBCExe project that can be executed to display a form for loading and
running this DLL. Allows you to build a dll for one IBDAC-based project,
and load and test it from a separate application.
