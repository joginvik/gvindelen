  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I am having a problem installing IBDAC or compiling IBDAC-based projects...</span><br>
    <span class="A">
  <p>
  You may be having a compatibility issue that shows up in one or more of the following forms:<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a "Setup has detected already installed DAC packages which are incompatible with 
	  current version" message during IBDAC installation.
      <li>Get a "Procedure entry point ... not found in ... " message when starting IDE.
      <li>Get a "Unit ... was compiled with a different version of ..." message on compilation.
  </ul> 
  <p>
  You can have such problems if you installed incompatible IBDAC, SDAC, ODAC or MyDAC versions. 
  All these products use common base packages. The easiest way to avoid the problem is to uninstall 
  all installed DAC products and then download from our site and install the last builds.</p></span>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What software should be installed on a client computer  for IBDAC-based 
	applications to work?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>The minimal configuration of client installation includes the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Copy the client file <i>gds32.dll</i> to the folder available for executable unit of your program. 
		For example, to the folder with your executable file, or to the Windows system folder.
        For more information, see description of the <i>LoadLibrary</i> function and the 
		environment variable <i>PATH</i>.
      </li>

	  <li>
		Add the "gds_db 3050/tcp" line to the <i>services</i> file in the <i>%WinDir%\system32\drivers\etc</i> directory.<br>
        For Firebird version 1.0.0.338 and higher, both client and server use port 3050 by default. So, you do not need to 
        modify the <i>services</i> file. You can also specify port number for the Firebird client in connection string  -
        <i>server/3050:c:\dir\data.gdb</i>
      </li>

	  <li>
        Copy file <i>InterBase.msg</i> (or <i>firebird.msg</i> for Firebird) to the folder
        available for executable unit of your program. File must belong to the same version as InterBase
        or Firebird.

<span id="Category">Performance</span>
<ol>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How productive is IBDAC?</span><br >
    <span class="A">
    <p>IBDAC uses low-level protocol to access the database server. This allows IBDAC to achieve high performance. 
	From time to time we compare IBDAC with other products, and IBDAC always takes first place. For more 
	information refer to <a href="http://www.devart.com/ibdac/perform.html" target="_blank">online test results</a>.</p>
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Why does the Locate function work so slowly the first time I use it?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>Locate is performed on the client. So if you had set FetchAll to False when opening your 
    dataset, cached only some of the rows on the client, and then invoked Locate, IBDAC will have to fetch all 
    the remaining rows from the server before performing the operation. On subsequent calls, Locate should 
    work much faster.</p>
    <p>If the Locate method keeps working slowly on subsequent calls or you are working with FetchAll=True, try the 
    following. Perform local sorting by a field that is used in the Locate method. Just assign corresponding field 
    name to the IndexFieldNames property.</p>
    </span>
  </li>

</ol>

<span id="Category">How To</span>
<ol>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How can I enable syntax highlighting in IBDAC component editors at design time?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>To enable syntax highlighting for IBDAC, you should download and install the freeware 
	<A HREF="http://synedit.sourceforge.net/">SynEdit component set</A>.</p>
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How can I determine which version of IBDAC I am using?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>You can determine your IBDAC version number in several ways:
      <ul>
        <li>During installation of IBDAC, consult the IBDAC Installer screen.
        <li>After installation, see the <i>history.html</i> file in your IBDAC installation directiory.
        <li>At design-time, select InterBase | About IBDAC from the main menu of your IDE.
        <li>At run-time, check the value of the IbdacVersion and DACVersion constants.
      </ul></p>
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How can I stop the cursor from changing to an hour glass during query execution?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>Just set the DBAccess.ChangeCursor variable to False anywhere in your program.  
	The cursor will stop changing after this command is executed.</p></span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How can I execute a query saved in the SQLInsert, SQLUpdate, SQLDelete, 
	or SQLRefresh properties of a IBDAC dataset?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>The values of these properties are templates for query statements, 
	and they cannot be manually executed. Usually there is no need to fill these properties
	because the text of the query is generated automatically.</p>
    
    <p> In special cases, you can set these properties to perform more complicated processing 
	during a query. These properties are automatically processed by IBDAC during the execution 
	of the Post, Delete, or RefreshRecord methods, and are used to construct the query to 
	the server.  Their values can contain parameters with names of fields in the underlying 
	data source, which will be later replaced by appropriate data values. </p> 

    <p>For example, you can use the SQLInsert template to insert a row into a query instance as follows.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Fill the SQLInsert property with the parametrized query template you want to use.
    <li>Call Insert.
    <li>Initialize field values of the row to insert.
    <li>Call Post.
    </ol>

    <p>The value of the SQLInsert property will then be used by IBDAC to perform the last step.</p>  

    <p>Setting these properties is optional and allows you to automatically execute additional 
	SQL statements, add calls to stored procedures and functions, check input parameters, and/or 
	store comments during query execution. If these properties are not set, the IBDAC dataset 
	object will generate the query itself using the appropriate insert, update, delete, or 
	refresh record syntax.</p>
     </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Some questions about the visual part of IBDAC</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>
    The following questions usually arise from the same problem:
    <ul>
      <li>I set the Debug property to True but nothing happens!
      <li>While executing a query, the screen cursor does not change to an hour-glass.
      <li>Even if I have LoginPromp set to True, the connect dialog does not appear.
    </ul>
    To fix this problem, you should add the IbDacVcl (for Windows) or  IbDacClx (for Linux)
    unit to the uses clause of your project.</p></span>
  </li>

</li>
</ol>

<span id="Category">General Questions</span>
<ol>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I would like to develop an application that works with InterBase Server. 
    Which should I use - IBDAC or dbExpress?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
    <p>
    dbExpress technology serves for providing a more or less uniform way to access different servers 
	(SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and so on). It is based on drivers that include server-specific features. 
	Like any universal tool, in many specialized cases dbExpress providers lose some functionality. 
	For example, the dbExpress design-time is quite poor and cannot be expanded.</p>

    <p>
    IBDAC is a specialized set of components to access InterBase server with advanced design-time and
    component interface similar to BDE.
    </p>

    <p>
    We tried to implement maximal InterBase support in IBDAC. dbExpress technology puts severe restrictions.
    For example, Unicode fields cannot be passed from the driver to dbExpress.
    </p>

    <p>
    In some cases dbExpress is slower because data undergoes additional conversion to correspond to
    dbExpress standards.
    </p>

    <p>
	To summarise, if it is important for you to be able to quickly adapt your application to a 
	database server other than InterBase, it is probably better to use dbExpress. In other cases, 
	especially when migrating from BDE or ADO, you should use IBDAC. </span>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Why use IBDAC instead of standard InterBase Express components?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>There are many reasons why IBDAC is better than IBExpress. Some of them are enumerated here. 
    For more information refer to IBDAC features list.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reliable user support - we help to solve common issues quickly using e-mail or dedicated forum.</li>
      <li>IBDAC is being constantly improved and enhanced, so you can be sure that the product is always 
          up-to-date with the latest InterBase data access technology advances.</li>
      <li>Better support for BLOBs, Arrays and other advanced features of the databases.</li>
      <li>Automatic generation of SQL UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, LOCK statements, so that you do not 
        need to care about routine tasks.</li>
      <li>Ability to lock records automatically, which helps you build stable multiuser applications more easily.</li>
      <li>Unicode and national charsets support in all IBDAC components</li>
      <li>IBDAC shares the same troubleproof engine with the other famous DAC products - ODAC, MyDAC, and SDAC. 
        So if you have worked with one of them, it will be easier for you to switch to another one if you ever need to integrate support for another database server in your application.</li>
    </ul>
    </span>
  </li>


  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Are the IBDAC connection components thread-safe?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>Yes, IBDAC is thread-safe but there is a restriction. The same TIBCConnection object 
	cannot be used in several threads. So if you have a multithreaded application, you should have a 
	TIBCConnection object for each thread that uses IBDAC.</p></span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Behaviour of my application has changed when I upgraded IBDAC. How can I restore the old behaviour with the new version?</span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>We always try to keep IBDAC compatible with previous versions, but sometimes we have to change behaviour of IBDAC in order to enhance its functionality, or avoid bugs. If either of changes is undesirable for your application, and you want to save the old behaviour, please refer to the "Compatibility with previous versions" topic in IBDAC help. This topic describes such changes, and how to revert to the old IBDAC behaviour.</p></span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">When editing a DataSet, I get an exception with the message 'Update failed. 
	Found %d records.' or 'Refresh failed. Found %d records.'
   </span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>This error occurs when the database server is unable to determine which record 
	to modify or delete. In other words, there are either more than one record or no records that suit 
	the UPDATE criteria. Such situation can happen when you omit the unique field in a SELECT statement 
	(TCustomDADataSet.SQL) or when another user modifies the table simultaneously. This exception can
	be suppressed. Refer to TCustomDADataSet.Options topic in IBDAC help for more information.</p>
  </span>

    <span class="A"><p>Fields of this type are represented in Delphi by TLargeIntField objects. 
	In some versions of Delphi, you cannot access these fields through the Value property (see 
	the protected method TLargeintField.SetVarValue in the DB unit for details). To avoid this 
	problem, you can change the field type to INT, which is usually sufficient for key fields. 
	Alternatively, you can avoid using Value.</p></span>

    <p>Yes. There is no problem with using both IBDAC and BDE functions in the same application.</p>
